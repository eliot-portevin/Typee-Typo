## Introduction
The main purpose of Typee Typo is to help people evaluate the evolution of their typing speed. This tool wasn't optimised for regular training, but can be used so if wished. The long term objective would be for me to make my Maturarbeit on this, firstly on how I got the program to work, and secondly on analysing the evolution of all of your performances and comparing them (you won't be put at competition don't worry). Some of the services included so far:
- Speed testing in English, French and German
- Analysis of personal data each time the program runs
- Possibility to turn the awful music off


## Getting Help
If you're struggling with the installation, or if you need any kind of advice from and old and wise man, please contact me at ***eliot.portevin@stud.edubs.ch***. 

If you wish to add a feature to the program, you are also free to modify the one you have cloned from this repository, and to show it to me when it is fully tested (if it is a good idea of course).

## Installation
### Mac OS
On this Operating System, Python is already installed by default. If not, or if you wish to have the latest version running, visit their website https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Next, you will need to install the Git command in order to clone this repository. To do so, run
```
$ git version
```
If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/mac.
