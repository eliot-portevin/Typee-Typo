## Introduction
The main purpose of Typee Typo is to help people evaluate the evolution of their typing speed. This tool wasn't optimised for regular training, but can be used so if wished. The long term objective would be for me to make my Maturarbeit on this, firstly explaining how I got the program to work, and in a second part analysing the evolution of your performances and comparing them (you won't be put at competition don't worry). Some of the services included so far:
- Speed testing in English, French and German
- Analysis of personal data each time the program runs
- Possibility to turn the awful music off

***This program is Open-Source, so you are free to modify it according to your desires. However, I won't be able to help you if it doesn't run after your modifications.***

## Getting Help
If you're struggling with the installation, or if you need any kind of advice from and old and wise man, please contact me at ***eliot.portevin@stud.edubs.ch***. 

If you wish to add a feature to the program, you are also free to modify the one you have cloned from this repository, and to show it to me when it is fully tested (if it is a good idea of course).

## Installation
### Mac OS
*(All the commands listed below have to be run in the terminal application without the dollar sign, it just shows the beginning of the commands. Don't be scared of the command line, you'll have to use it anyways to run the program, and you'll look like a hacker.)*

On this Operating System, Python is already installed by default. If not, or if you wish to have the latest version running, visit their website https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Next, you will need to install the Git command in order to clone this repository. To do so, run
```
$ git version
```
If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.
If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/mac.

Now you can clone this repository (all the files at the top of the page) in your desired directory. To do so, open your terminal and move to the desired path with the  ```cd```  command. If you do not know how this works, this video explains it well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6vKLJxAKfw. Next you can run this command to download the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/eliot-portevin/Typee-Typo.git
```
You now have all the needed files to run this program in you new Typee-Typo directory! Go to the Running part to see how you can use it now.

### Linux
If you're running Linux (congrats' because I wouldn't expect any of you to), I'm assuming you know how to use the command line, clone a repository and run a python script, so I'm not including any directions for you. If you're really in a struggle though, just take a look at the MacOS tutorial, it's literaly the same thing. To install git, just run ```sudo apt install git```if you're on a debian-based machine, or ```yay -S git```if you're on Arch (I'm not sure about this one though).


### Windows
